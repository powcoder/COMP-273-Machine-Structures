# The snippet of code below contains a main function which calls the subroutine ``length''
# and then prints an integer result. The subroutine takes a single argument, which is the address
# of a NULL terminated string, and# generates a return value, which is the length of the string.
# Using appropriate register conventions complete the code for the subroutine ``length'', providing
# brief comments as well.


       .data
str:   .asciiz "This is a test string."

       .text
       .globl main

main:  la $a0,str
       jal length               # call to the subroutine length

       add $s1,$zero,$v0

       li $v0,1                 # system call code for print_int
       add $a0, $zero, $s1
       syscall

       j Exit


# The subroutine ``length'' begins here:
	
length: add $v0,$zero,$zero	# use $v0 as the counter and initialize it

loop:	lb $t0,0($a0)		# load the ascii value of a character into $t0
	beq $t0,$zero,done	# reached the NULL character so we are done
	addi $v0,$v0,1		# increment count
	addi $a0,$a0,1		# advance pointer by 1
	j loop			# continue loop


done:	jr $ra	


Exit:	li $v0,10
	syscall
